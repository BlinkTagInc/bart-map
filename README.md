#BART System Map

An open source BART system map I designed for developers who want to include a simple BART map in their applications.

##Source

The 'app map' is available on github and on BART's website in AI and .png formats at http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/maps.aspx

##Example

Use the AI file to change the base map, line colors and widths, fonts, and more.
