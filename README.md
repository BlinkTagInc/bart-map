#BART System Map

An open source BART system map I designed for developers who want to include a simple BART map in their applications.

Layers not shown in the above screenshot include geographic region labels and approximate minutes between stations.

##Source

The 'app map' is available [on github](https://github.com/trucy/bart-map) and [on BART's website](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/maps.aspx) in AI and .png formats.

##Example

Use the AI file to change the base map, line colors and widths, fonts, and more.
